In this folder you will find two folders
wingraph - The base folder for the wingraph unit (Aswell as documentation and demo programs)
WinGraphExt - Contains a program I made using this unit (Uses spritemasks aswell)

I have added An extra Function in Wingraph to allow for the drawing of partial sprites.
